# Payment Calculator

This Python program calculates the total cost of a product based on different payment options. It provides the following payment methods:

- Cash payment with a discount.
- Cash payment with a smaller discount when using a card.
- Payment in installments with varying interest rates when using a card.

To use the program, simply input the price of the product and choose the payment option. The program will then display the total cost according to your choice, considering any applicable discounts or interest rates.

This calculator is designed to help users quickly estimate the cost of a product based on different payment methods and is particularly useful for comparing cash and credit card payments.
